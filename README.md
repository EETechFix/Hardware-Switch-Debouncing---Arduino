# Hardware-Switch-Debouncing-Arduino
Mechanical switch noise (switch bounce) and its effects. Weâ€™ll explore hardware debounce solutions based on resistor-capacitor filter networks and dedicated logic ICs. Switch bounces is the mechanical action that occurs when contacts come together, causing a rapid making and breaking action before the contacts come to rest.
